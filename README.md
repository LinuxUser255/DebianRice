# DebianRice

```
This is a somewhat rough and hacked together script, but it gets the job done. 
I will probably edit it sometime in the future, make it look better and use a CSV.
Feel free to make any suggestions, push requests etc..
```
To download and install this script, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxUser255/DebianRice/main/carbs.sh
sh carbs.sh
```
